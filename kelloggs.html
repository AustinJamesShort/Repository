<h3>Kellogg's Cereal</h3>
<h4>Cocoa Krispies Commercial</h4>
<p class="projectparagraph">The love many have for cereal is a powerful thing, especially among children. Kellogg's often advertises their most popular cereals on kid's television shows. I was tasked with creating a comical commercial for Kellogg's Cocoa Krispies cereal. They wanted the commercial to make kids laugh while expressing the great taste of Cocoa Krispies. Kellogg's gave me 5 boxes of cereal to use for this advertisement.</p>
	
<h4>Approach</h4>
<p class="projectparagraph">Cereal is an important part of the day for many children. They look forward to having their favorite type of cereal every morning. I have even, on occassion, seen my younger cousins cry when they are refused their favorite sugary breakfast item. I decided that this was a good angle with which I could begin. I built on this idea and decided to portray a man that simply could not live without his cereal.</p>

	
<h4>Editing</h4>
<p class="projectparagraph">I began by videotaping a man during his morning routine. He rises out of bed, walks to the kitchen and grabs his favorite cereal. After pouring a full bowl, he grabs a cup and accidentally knocks the cereal into the sink. This causes him visible distress. The narration suggests that he was never the same after that incident. The full commercial is shown below.</p>
