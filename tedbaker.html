<h3>Ted Baker London</h3>
<h4>Watch Advertisement</h4>
<p class="projectparagraph">Watch advertising often involves the representation of a lifestyle through a product. When Ted Baker London launched a new style, they required an ad that portrayed a lifestyle that was idealized by their target audience. In this case, they needed to envoke feelings of adventure and luxury. I was given a single watch to photograph.</p>
	
<h4>Materials</h4>
<p class="projectparagraph">I decided to go with leather and binoculars as the complimentary elements in the photograph. Specifically, I found old, vintage binoculars, a vintage leather satchel and a leather-bound notebook. To me, these items represent durability and longevity, as well as luxury and adventure. Am I going on a safari? Will I write about my adventures? What treasures can I bring back with me? These are the types of questions I wanted the image to provoke.</p>
	
<h4>The Photo</h4>
<p class="projectparagraph">It was mandatory that the watch be the focal point of the image. I used the lines on the satchel, as well as the orientation of the binoculars and notebook, to draw attention to the watch. I used the camera settings to bring only the watch itself into focus, allowing the scenery to be visible, but not prominent. This technique brings the watch to your attention first, then allows your eyes to move around the image and create a story with the other items. What sort of adventure does this image present to you? The final image is shown below.</p>
